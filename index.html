<h1>Downtime over for www.freegeek.org, Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:07:46 -0700</h1>
<pre>
Our cloud server vendor was able to resolve a problem with our
account's metadata, which I expect happened due to the age of our
account and host machine (I will get details later).<br />
I verified they fixed it on their end and it is working now.<br /><br />
UPDATE: The issue was resolved by repairing our filesystem, but no
explanation as to why rescue mode failed to boot was provided.
</pre>

<h1>Downtime extended for www.freegeek.org, Sat, 06 Jul 2013 22:49:22 -0700</h1>
<pre>
I completed my upgrade successfully and for testing purposes rebooted
the server, during which I noticed a potential hardware problem with
the filesystem of the server www.freegeek.org is hosted on.<br />
Our cloud server vendor's team is looking into the problem, which
required them to take the entire server down. I will post updates, but
am not sure when they will have it fixed.
</pre>

<h1>Downtime beginning for www.freegeek.org, Sat, 06 Jul 2013 22:02:20 -0700</h1>

I already upgraded the Wordpress installation now for security updates
and will be upgrading the rest of the services hosted there tonight,
which may cause the server to be down for a period of time.

I will post status updates to http://status.freegeek.org/ throughout.

If you notice anything unordinary with the website or related services
after the upgrades I've done or will be doing, please let me know.

<h1>Server maintenance Sunday 2012-02-19</h1>
<pre>
We expect to be rebooting several servers at freegeek for some routine and
brief maintenance between the hours of 11am and 5pm on Sunday, February 19th.

We will be replacing the hardware on one of the core servers for our network,
which will bring down most services for the internal network, although all
internet accessible services should continue to work.

We will also be replacing the batteries in the UPSes, and we might be able do
that without taking servers down, but we may briefly take something down if
needed.
